**Introduction**
----------------

iamavailablefor.work (abbreviated as IAAFW) is an open source website written in PHP which allows you to register your own iamavailablefor.work/{profile_name} web address for free. You can redirect this web address to your own personal blog/portfolio/website, or use our profile editor to build and customise your own portfolio.

IAAFW was written with a range of technologies and other open source softwares:

+ [CodeIgniter 3](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/)
+ [Aauth](https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth/)
+ [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
+ More...

The master branch of this repository gets pulled by my server automatically whenever changes are made to it, so once a pull request has been accepted and merged with the master branch, your changes will instantly become visible on the live domain!

**Roadmap:**
------------

I wanted to keep this project simple, but now that I've open sourced it, I have a few feature ideas which I'd like implemented into the project.

**Core changes:**

 - Currently, there is only one theme implemented into the project. It would be cool if multiple themes were created and the user could select which theme they'd like to use on their profile.

**Code changes:**

 - Add [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) into the project so CSS and JS files can be minified and compressed, reducing load on the server.
